# ElectricityBillAutomation

The app validates the consumer number, getting the respective units consumed for the users, Calculating the bill amount based on the units consumed, and more process were done manually which consumes more 
working time.  So, the Electricity Board decides to outsource the billing process of their domestic consumers to Global Tek Software Company. 

This project captures the various concepts, techniques and skills learnt and help to put them into practice using C# with ADO.NET that a software engineer must solve.

The scope of the system:
1. Get input data related to electricity bill and calculate the bill amount. 
2. Store the ElectricityBill of each customer.
3. Retrieve the last ‘N’ number of bill details from the database.
